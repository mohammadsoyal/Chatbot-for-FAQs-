## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FAQChatbot.git
cd FAQChatbot
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, manually install:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas nltk scikit-learn
```

4. **Download NLTK resources:**

The script will automatically download `punkt` and `stopwords`, or you can do it manually:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Running the App

```bash
streamlit run chatbot.py
```

Then open the link it gives (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser.

## CSV Format

Make sure your FAQ CSV has the following columns:

| question                      | answer                              |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| What is the battery life?    | The battery lasts up to 10 hours.   |
| Does it support fast charge? | Yes, it supports 30W fast charging. |

---

## Notes

- If no CSV is uploaded via the UI, it uses the default path:  
  `D:\AI INTERNSHIP\chatbotfaq\FAQChatbot\Faqs_100.csv`
- Confidence score is displayed for each response.
- You can clear the chat anytime.

## Future Improvements

- Support for multilingual questions  
- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or Render  
- Integrate with a real product API
